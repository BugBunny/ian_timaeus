This presentation discusses a method for making detailed fertility estimates from a census age distribution. First, I describe the method and then I illustrate its potential using some results for four Eastern and Southern African countries.
The method was first proposed by Luther and Cho in 1998 and can be thought of as an elaboration of the Own-Children Method of estimating fertility. The key idea is to supplement information on the ages of womenâ€™s own children with information from the summary birth history ("Brass") questions about how many children individual woman have borne in total and how many of their children have since died.
