The first half of the lecture reviews some of the research I have been involved in aimed at improving our understanding of the demographic impact of the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. In essence, this research seeks to establish how many people are dying of AIDS in Africa and who they are. The second half of the lecture, on the other hand, is concerned with research that is trying to learn a bit more about the socioeconomic impact of the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. In essence, this research aims to learn a bit more about the impact of the AIDS epidemic on poverty and on the development process.
